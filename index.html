  <div class="bio">
      <p>I have always been creative, it runs in my blood. My father is a musician and my grandfather was a painter. I knew from a young age I wanted to create beautiful things; Making money off those things would just be an added bonus. It’s my love of movies that drove me to be a motion designer. I was always intrigued by the behind the scenes. I would always watch the special features after the movie to see how everything was made. I loved watching the animations come to life through the process.

I wanted to apply this creativity to advertising and awareness. There is always a story to be told, I and want to make that story come to life. Make people feel something through my art that can’t always be achieved by looking at a still image. There are always new things to learn and create. The inspiration is endless, and seeing it all come together is most mind-blowing, and satisfying experience one can have. </p>
